          SDB (Simple Database) is a small database based on PHP I have developed many years ago (2010 to be precise) as my hobby / school project in my high scool days. I have still learning PHP language on my own and I was using database such as MySQL. I thought why not create my own database for fun. I had to learn a lot especially regular expression in PHP to undertake this task. I have spent days after days of researching and coding to make this project come true. Although being really basic and unsafe compared to other databases this is one of my longest programming project to date and I am proud of it.          </div>
